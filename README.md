# Mario Jump Game

This project is a simple Mario-inspired jumping game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the classic mechanics of the iconic Mario game where the player has to jump over obstacles to reach the end.

## How to Play

   - Use the `spacebar` key to make Mario jump.
   - Navigate through obstacles by timing your jumps correctly.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Gain points by successfully avoiding obstacles and reaching higher platforms.
   - The game ends when Mario collides with an obstacle.

3. **Restart:**
   - If Mario collides with an obstacle, press the `spacebar` to restart the game.

## Technologies Used
